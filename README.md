The attached Zip file contains our Disassembler code.
The purpose of these are to read in Object codes and Symbol files while an Assembly listing file is the output.
The program uses input.cpp to read in the Object codes and Symbols files.
Using these the Disassembler class is created to decode these into an Assembly file.
